# SQLTestBench
This is just a collection of SQL scripts for PostgreSQL that I add to whenever I am testing something that I'm learning about. 

It could be useful to others so please feel free to reference and use. And please ignore some of the company-specific references, sometimes when I make these I am thinking about problems that I am facing at work.
